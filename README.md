### ArcGIS API Story Map


### This map was created based on the Week 6 assignment videos which show how to develop individual points on a 3D map. I used the basic structure provided in the downloadable zip and changed the latitude, longitude, name, city, and state for five points to tell you a little about myself. With the help of the link provided to Esri, I could create a Zoom.to feature that allows users to zoom into each point when clicked on, I added a cluster feature too, To break up the points when you zoom out and they become too close together, I adjusted the pop-up window to show the city, state, and coordinates of each point, and finally, I added a search widget also provided on the ESRI website so that each point could be searched by city name and then be zoomed into once the name is entered. To adjust each point from the "simple point" used in the tutorial, I created diamond shapes and changed their colors by changing small aspects of the code provided. The map shows you where I was born, Where I am currently going to Graduate School, What I consider to be my Hometown, my favorite trip I have taken with my dad, and my dream vacation to the Valcano National Park. I hope you enjoy and learn a little something about me through the exploration of my simple map.
