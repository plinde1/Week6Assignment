# ArcGIS API Story Map


### This map was created based on the Week 6 assignment videos which show how to create individual points on a 3D map. 
### I used the basic structer provide in the downloadable zip and changed the latitude, longitude, name, city, and state for five points to tell you a little bit about myself.
### With the help of the link provided to Esri, I was able to create a zoom.to feature that allows users to zoom into each point when clicked on, I added a cluster feature to,
### to break up the points when you zoom out and they become too close togther, I adjusted the pop-up window to show city, state, and coordinates of each point, and finally 
### I added a search widget also provided on the esri website so that each point could be searched by city name and then be zoomed into once the name is entered.
### To adjust each point from the "simple-point" used in the tutorial, I created diamond shapes and changed their colors by changins small aspects of the code provided.
### The map shows you where I was born, Where I am currently going to Gradaute School, What I consider to be my Hometown, my favorite trip I have taken with my dad,
### and my dream vacation to the Valcano Natioanl Park. I hope you enjoy and learn a little something about me through the exploration of my simple map.
